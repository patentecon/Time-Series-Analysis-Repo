## Use R Project for Your Coursework

-   Allows quick switching between projects within the RStudio IDE.

-   Opening a project restores your open tabs from last use.

-   Encourages organised file structure practices, notably a project should contain all files used by that project.

## Create a New Project

## Select New Directory

## Select New Project

## Name Your Project

## Main Packages

-   Install the following packages: install.packages(c("tidyverse", "fpp3"))

## Load ffp3 package

-   Load fpp3 package

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| echo: true
#| message: true
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Hidden code"
library(fpp3)

```

## Benefits of using a Project

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: true
cars
```

## Benefits of using a Project

-   Create a data folder, and then write a file in csv format.

-   This way we use relative paths instead of absolute paths

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: true
readr::write_csv(cars, "data/cars.csv")
```

## Check the type of data

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: true
data()
```

-   In ECON 41 you used data.frame and/or tibble.
-   What is the type of cars?

## What is the type of cars?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: true
class(cars)
```

What is the type of AirPassengers?

## What is the type of AirPassengers?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: true
class(AirPassengers)
```

What is the type of us_rent_income?

## What is the type of us_rent_income?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: true
us_rent_income
```

What is the type of global_economy?

## What is the type of global_economy?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: true
global_economy
```

tsibble objects extend tidy data frames (tibble objects) by introducing temporal structure and works well with tidyverse functions.

## tsibble Objects

1.  **Index** is a variable with inherent ordering from past to present.
2.  **Key** is a set of variables that define observational units over time.
3.  Each observation should be uniquely identified by index and key.
4.  Each observational unit should be measured at a common interval, if regularly spaced.
